# „ÄêGovernorAlpha with Proof of Voting NFT„Äë
## „ÄêIntroduction of the GovernorAlpha with Proof of Voting NFT„Äë
- This is the smart contract that incentivize voters (of compound) by using the proof of voting NFTs. 
  - Once a token holder (of COMP) execute voting, that token holder receive a NFT as a proof of voting.
  - As a incentive to keep engaging in voting, token holders who has voting NFTs can receive rewards regularly.

<br>

- This smart contract try to solve current disadvantage of on-chain voting that:
  - Token holders (of COMP) need to pay GasFee‚õΩÔ∏è for every voting. (In case token holders vote by themself)
  - Small share holders (of COMP) has less voting power than large share holders.
    ‚Üì
    - By distributing rewards via this smart contract like above, all token holders (of COMP) can get benefit to engage in voting even if they are small share holders (of COMP).

## „ÄêWorkflow„Äë
- Workflow
  - ‚ë† Create a proposal (from voters to the GovernorAlphaWithProofOfVotingNFT contract).
  - ‚ë° Create a proposal (from the GovernorAlphaWithProofOfVotingNFT contract to the GovernorAlpha contract).  
    => Workflow of ‚ë† and ‚ë° above are execute via the GovernorAlphaWithProofOfVotingNFT contract in a single transaction.  
  - ‚ë¢ Cast a vote (from voters to the GovernorAlphaWithProofOfVotingNFT contract).  
  - ‚ë£ Cast a vote (from the GovernorAlphaWithProofOfVotingNFT contract to the GovernorAlpha contract).  
    => Workflow of ‚ë¢ and ‚ë£ above are execute via the GovernorAlphaWithProofOfVotingNFT contract in a single transaction.  
  - ‚ë§ Create a new `proof of voting NFT` .
  - ‚ë• Mint a proof of voting NFT.
  - ‚ë¶ Transfer a proof of voting NFT to voter who is voted.
  - ‚ëß Distribute reward tokens (COMP) `based on number of a proof of voting NFTs` .
    - On the assumption that, 1 proof of voting NFT is given to voter per 1 vote . 
    - On the assumption that, default `reward distribution amount` is `0.01` COMP.
      https://github.com/masaun/governorAlpha-with-proof-of-voting-NFT/blob/main/contracts/RewardsVault.sol#L20
      (‚Äª the reward distribution amount can be changed by using `changeDistributionAmount` method in the RewardsVault.sol: https://github.com/masaun/governorAlpha-with-proof-of-voting-NFT/blob/main/contracts/RewardsVault.sol#L30-L32 )

    - e.g). If some voter vote 2 different proposal, that voter receive 2 proof of voting NFTs.  
      => In case of that, that voter receive `0.02 COMP (=0.01 * 2 NFTs)` regulary.

    - Remarks). 
      - At the moment, the `manual` distribution method has been implemented already. ( https://github.com/masaun/governorAlpha-with-proof-of-voting-NFT/blob/main/contracts/RewardsVault.sol#L44-L52 )
      - But, the `reqular` distribution method has not been implemented yet.
