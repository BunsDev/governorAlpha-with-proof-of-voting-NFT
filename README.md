# 【Compound Governance Voting with NFT】
## 【Introduction of the Compound Governance Voting with NFT】
- This is the smart contract that is combination of Voting and NFT.
  - Once a token holder execute voting, he/she receive a NFT as a proof of voting.

  - As a incentive for engagement of voting, token holders who has voting NFTs can get rewards regularly.

  - Current disadvantage of on-chain voting (especially for small share holders) is that:
    - token holders need to pay GasFee⛽️ for every voting.
    - small share holder has less voting power than large share holders.
